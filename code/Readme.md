# Code
- The code first imports necessary libraries like transformers, torch, and datasets. It then loads a dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas dataframe. The dataframe is processed to generate a new dataset in JSON format, with each data point containing an instruction, input text, and expected output text. The Llama model and tokenizer are initialized and prepared for 8-bit quantization using the Peft library. The JSON dataset is loaded and tokenized. The tokenized prompts are split into train and validation sets. The model is prepared for low-rank adaptation with the LoraConfig. Training arguments are defined and the model is compiled before being trained on the tokenized prompt data. In summary, the code loads a dataset, processes and tokenizes it, and then trains a quantized Llama model on the tokenized data using low-rank adaptation provided by Peft.
