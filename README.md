## Github Description

### GitHub Repository Description:
- The "ECON211_Yiwei" GitHub repository by Yiwei Liang offers a comprehensive exploration of Explainable AI (XAI) in healthcare diagnostics and financial data analysis. The repository delves into Ploug and Holm's XAI concept, emphasizing contestability in AI diagnostics. Yiwei extends XAI to finance, employing Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models (LoRA) for real-time finance information analysis. The methodology and code sections detail implementation using the Peft library. A dataset on gold price forecasts and news headlines facilitates testing. Citations from key papers underscore academic rigor. Explore for theoretical insights, empirical studies, and practical code implementations in the evolving XAI landscape.
