## Github Description

### GitHub Repository Description:

- This GitHub repository, named "ECON211_Yiwei," is a comprehensive collection of research and code contributions by Yiwei Liang. With a strong background in computer technology and proficiency in languages such as Python and Java, Yiwei focuses on cutting-edge topics in artificial intelligence, particularly in the realm of Explainable AI (XAI).

### Research Highlights:

- The repository includes a detailed exploration of the concept of Explainable AI (XAI) through an in-depth analysis of Ploug and Holm's (2020) paper. Emphasizing the importance of "contestability," the research delves into patient-centric dimensions that individuals should be able to contest in AI diagnostics. Theoretical analyses and empirical studies contribute to the formulation of a precise definition of XAI, and experimental testing outlines a practical approach to enhance contestability.

### Frontiers of XAI in Finance:

- Yiwei's research extends to the frontiers of XAI in finance, addressing the challenges posed by the dynamic nature of financial data. The repository introduces a novel approach leveraging large language models, specifically the Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models (LoRA) technology. The central research question revolves around the effective employment of large language models in developing a finance information analyzer, with a focus on real-time deployment.

### Research Methodology and Code:

- The repository provides a detailed methodology for both XAI contestability research and finance information analysis. The code section encompasses the implementation of the Low-Rank Adaptation using the Peft library, showcasing the practical application of the outlined methodologies. Additionally, there's a comprehensive code section that covers the preparation and training of models for real-world scenarios.

### Data and Visualization:

- The repository includes a dataset related to gold price forecasts and news headlines, offering a valuable resource for testing and implementing the proposed methodologies. Flowcharts and visual representations aid in understanding the research processes and code implementation.

### Citations and Contributions:

- Citations from key papers, such as Ploug and Holm (2020) and Hu et al. (2021), showcase the academic rigor underlying the research. Yiwei's contributions to the field of finance and XAI are evident in the integration of theoretical insights, empirical studies, and practical code implementations.
### Summary
- Explore this repository to gain insights into the evolving landscape of XAI, especially in the context of healthcare diagnostics and financial data analysis, backed by well-documented research and code contributions.
